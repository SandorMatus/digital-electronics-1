### Traffic light controller

1. Figure of traffic light controller state diagram. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Always name all states, transitions, and input signals!

2. Listing of VHDL code of the completed process `p_traffic_fsm`. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

```vhdl
    --------------------------------------------------------
    -- p_traffic_fsm:
    -- The sequential process with synchronous reset and 
    -- clock_enable entirely controls the s_state signal by 
    -- CASE statement.
    --------------------------------------------------------
    p_traffic_fsm : process(clk)
    begin
      
    end process p_traffic_fsm;
```

3. Screenshot with simulated time waveforms. The full functionality of the entity must be verified. Always display all inputs and outputs (display the inputs at the top of the image, the outputs below them) at the appropriate time scale!
